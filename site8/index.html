2. Arasaka
3. Petrochem
4. Kang Tao
5. Militech
6. Biotechnica



How the stocks work:



 1. Each stock changes by a random small percentage (positive or negative) every 5 seconds (realtime). 
 2. You can expect a certain overall percentage gain (positive or negative) every 30 minutes of playtime.

Night City ETF:

Expect -5% average loss per 30 minutes. 
EACH GIG AND CYBERPSYCHO you complete IMPROVES THE AVERAGE GAIN BY .5%. So once you've completed all gigs and cyberpsychos, you can expect the Night City ETF to gain around +40% every 30 minutes.

Every 30 minutes, a random trend is chosen for each of the 5 companies.



Dynamic Influences:

- Keep in mind that all these influences only change the probability of a stock going up / down, it does not guarantee it
- All the stocks, as well as the news, are influenced by two dynamic aspects:

1. Quests:
- Most quests affect the trend of certain stocks, e.g. Completing "The Heist" â†’ Arasaka goes down, Militech goes up
- Stocks also influence each other, e.g. rivaling stocks such as Budget Arms and Darra Polytechnic

2. Player Actions
- There are 33 triggers that affect different stocks movement
- E.g. Killing NPCs of a faction will affect that companies stock (Kill NCPD Officer -> NCPD stock will drop)
- E.g. Causing lots of car accidents would make the Delamain stock go up
- And lots more!

TRENDING:

 1. SOARING: Expected to gain 70% in 30 minutes
 2. GROWING SLOWLY: 30%
 3. TRADING SIDEWAYS: 0%
 4. DECLINING SLOWLY: -10%
 5. TANKING: -40%

You don't know how each company is trending, so if you want steady income, 

 1. Complete gigs 
 2. Hunt cyberpsychos 
 3. Invest in Night City ETF


 Manipulating the Market:
 

- Using the above-mentioned Quest and Player Actions influences, you can easily take advantage of the stock market:
- Buy stocks from a corporation and then do a quest or gig that benefits them - Stock price is likely to go up, and you can reap the profits
- Find a quest or perform actions that tank a corporation's stock - Stock price is likely to drop, and you can buy while it's low
- Accuire stock Strategire from various locations near the fixers, for a price to predict the trending state of randomly chosen companies
